# Team Profile Generator --- Module 12 Challenge

## Description

The Team Profile Generator is a Node.js command-line application that enables users to create professional team profile webpages. Using the Inquirer package, the application prompts users to input information about their team members, including managers, engineers, and interns. Once all team members have been added, the application generates an HTML page with a clean layout, showcasing the team's structure and individual details. The generated webpage is saved as team.html using the file system module. This application simplifies the process of creating and sharing team profiles, providing a convenient and efficient solution for generating comprehensive team profiles.

## User Story

As a manager a user want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info so that a user have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles.
